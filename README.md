# Dreamshare Icons Library

Welcome to the Dreamshare Icons Library! This library allows you to easily add custom icons to your website using simple HTML `<i>` tags. Each icon can be accessed with a specific CSS class.

## Installation

To use the Dreamshare Icons Library, add the following script to your HTML file. This script loads the icons directly from the Dreamshare CDN:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://dreamshare.fr/lib/dreamshare-icon.js"></script>
Place this script in the <head> section or just before the closing <body> tag in your HTML file for proper loading.

How to Use the Icons
Once the library is loaded, you can display an icon by using an <i> tag with the corresponding class for the icon you want to display.

Example Usage:
<i class="gem"></i>
This will display the icon associated with the gem class.

Icon list :
<i class="medal1"></i>
<i class="medal2"></i>
<i class="medal3"></i>
<i class="moon"></i>
<i class="hey"></i>
<i class="gem"></i>
<i class="flame"></i>
<i class="favicon"></i>
<i class="dreamshare"></i>
